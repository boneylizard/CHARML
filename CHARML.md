# CHARML (Character Markup Language)

## Introduction
CHARML is a powerful and flexible markup language designed for creating and managing character profiles and world-building elements in interactive storytelling and AI applications. It combines structured data with natural language descriptions, offering clarity and ease of use.

## Syntax and Structure

  <!-- Additional tags and elements -->
</character>

Best Practices
Writing CHARML
Use clear and concise descriptions.
Ensure tags are properly nested.
Keep attribute names and values consistent.
Advanced Features
Conditional Logic
CHARML supports conditional logic for dynamic content.

Example:
xml
Copy code
<character>
  <name>Conditional Character</name>
  <description>A character with dynamic attributes based on conditions.</description>
  <traits>
    <condition>
      <if>heroic</if>
      <then>Brave, Strong, Leader</then>
      <else>Cunning, Deceptive, Survivor</else>
    </condition>
  </traits>
</character>
Versioning and Updates
We use semantic versioning for CHARML. You can find the details of each release in the CHANGELOG.md file.

Development for Multiple Platforms
CHARML was developed for Backyard.AI but is compatible with Kobold, LM Studio, and Silly Tavern, and has potential broader applications in the AI field.
